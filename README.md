# Cocktails App

This is a sample application written using Sencha Touch 2. At the time of writing this, Sencha Touch is on it's third Preview Release.

## Setup

I have not included Sencha Touch in this repository. The steps to include it are:

1. Download Sencha Touch 2 from the (Sencha Website)[http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/download/]
2. Unpack the SDK and move it to the `lib/touch2` directory (so you should have a `lib/touch2/sencha-all-debug.js` file).
3. Open index-debug.html

## Building the application

If you want to build the application and run the production version (index.html), you must use the SDK Tools. There is a how to available on my blog at (robertdougan.com)[http://robertdougan.com].
