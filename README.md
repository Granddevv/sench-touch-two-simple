# Sencha Touch 2 Simple App

This is a sample application written using Sencha Touch 2. At the time of writing this, Sencha Touch is on it's third Preview Release.

## Setup

The steps for installaction of Sencha to include it are:

1. Download Sencha Touch 2 from the [Sencha Website](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/download/)
2. Unpack the SDK and move it to the `lib/touch2` directory (so you should have a `lib/touch2/sencha-all-debug.js` file).
3. Open index-debug.html

## Building the application

You can also access the built version of the application by checking out the `built` branch (which still doens't include Sencha Touch SDK, but runs).
